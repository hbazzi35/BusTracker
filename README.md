# Bus Tracker
This is an interactive map displaying the bus route between the MIT campus and the Harvard campus.
## Description
The purpose of this project is to track the buses on route between the MIT and Harvard campasses. This is done by getting the location of the busses through MBTA and displaying it on a map generated with MapBox.
### How To Use
Using this program is very simple. Simply open the Index.html file in your browser and press the Start button in the upper left corner. I've also added the option to change between a navigation map layout and a satellite map layout. You can do this by using the "View" button.
## Future Improvments
I look forward to adding on to this program to include more bus routes in the MIT campus area. I would also like to create another map that tracks busses in the Downtown Detroit area.
